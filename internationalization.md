# Internationalization i18n

Appier supports both the localization thought template output using the `locale` filter
and the localization using multiple template files `x.LOCALE.xxx`.

The framework also sets the global operative system level locale value and so the operative
system must be ready to handle this changes.

Under Unix it's important to generate the appropriate locales for proper usage, otherwise
this global setting would fail to be set.

```bash
less /usr/share/i18n/SUPPORTED
sudo locale-gen pt_PT
sudo locale-gen pt_PT.utf8
```
